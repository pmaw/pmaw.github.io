<font face = "Courier" color = "black"> 
Programming models are widespread, and have gained vast popularity due to a
variety of optimization mechanisms and abstractions, their transparency and
other runtime features. Examples of these features are automatic accelerator
offloading, directive-based compiler optimizations and parallelization,
integration into high-level programming languages, locality enhancements, work
stealing and pushing, overlapping communication and computation, providing a
wide range of dynamic scheduling techniques, scaling and enabling the execution
of large scale applications for distributed computing, leveraging and exposing
interfaces that enable a fine grained control of underlying computing and
network hardware, among many other features. Despite this long list of major
advancements, there still exists a wide gap between the algorithmic design,
specification and implementation, and these programming models.
</p>

<p>
To exacerbate the problem at hand, it is widely known that to achieve the
expected levels of performance and power cap of Exascale and future computing
eras, tremendous efforts will have to be invested and will require the
convergence of several traditionally disjoint fields.  Programming models
excel at raising the level of abstraction from a concrete target platform,
architecture or even the underlying network. In other words, their primary role
is to hide the complexities of some lower level of the hardware and software
stack, thereby greatly simplifying and speeding the development process of
scientific software.
</p>

<p>
Complicating even more the matter, new technologies such as upcoming
programming models and parallel runtimes are not fully exploited. To a large
extent, this is caused by the unfamiliarity of domain experts and computational
scientists with new runtimes and software developments, or conversely, because
of the lack of knowledge of the runtime or compiler expert with the fundamental
properties of a computational algorithm. Moreover, simple mechanical porting of
traditional and classic algorithms, many of which were devised 40 or more years
ago, considered much more generic and abstract models such as the P-RAM model,
the Bulk-Synchronous Parallel (BSP) model, LogP, or even
the traditional von Neumann model. More precisely, this process has been
target agnostic, and did not envision any specific hardware or runtime. This
approach often results in suboptimal performance, loses important information
in translation or incorrectly exploits the algorithmic intrinsics.

<h3 id="section2"> Workshop Scope and Topics of Interest</h3>
<font face = "Courier" color = "black"> 
<h5>
<p>
The purpose of this workshop is to bring together experts of different areas to
bridge the gap between programming models and algorithms in general. The
ultimate goal is to foster the interdisciplinary relationships among domain
scientists, and compiler, language and runtime (CLR) experts in order to
re-design and rethink the next generation of algorithms that will be used
during the forthcoming decades. Therefore, the intended audience and
participants of the proposed workshop involves experts, practitioners,
students, professors and researchers of the mentioned fields, of the broader
computer science, applied mathematics and computational science fields.  In the
shorter term, the objective of this workshop is to enable and retarget core
algorithmic building blocks that leverage cutting-edge data-flow, task and
data-parallel runtimes, and gradually promote the absorption of undeniable
performance, energy and other execution properties that an algorithm should
embody in order to fully exploit future hardware and software computing
infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
We welcome ongoing and preliminary work, experience reports showing a negative
result or a gap between the two communities. In general, PMAW topics lie 
between fields of  domain scientists and CLR experts. For instance, domain experts
who are attempting to map their application to some specific platform or
runtime, as well as CLR experts wishing to identify and learn about strong and
impactful applications and benchmarks suitable for some new software technology.
</p>
<p>
All papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference.
The following is a non-exhaustive list of topics of interest:
<ul>
  <li>Implementation of algorithms using data-flow models and runtimes</li>
  <li>Domain specific languages, compilers and tools for data-flow, data and task parallelism</li>
  <li>New parallel runtime features that facilitate algorithmic description</li>
  <li>Rethinking of classical algorithms that incorporate parallelism, energy and other performance properties</li>
  <li>Communication minimization schemes</li>
  <li>Network aware computing</li>
  <li>Locality and Communication abstractions for algorithmic specification</li>
  <li>Orchestrating runtimes and heterogeneous runtime scheduling</li>
  <li>Experiences in porting or implementing scientific frameworks over one or more programming models</li>
  <li>A negative result demonstrating general poor support for some application or class of computation and potential solutions or workaround</li>
  <li>Application and runtime demos</li>
</ul>
